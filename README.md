Class Project: Classifying up to 18 types for 809 different pokemon. We were able to use any model that could potetntially generate the best results.
I've added the code to scrape the images("pokemon_download.py") and I've also added the code that  iterates through the file names and resizes the images.
Scraped image data set(100 images for 809 Pokemon):
